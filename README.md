# chimera-libhybris
Run [Chimera Linux](https://chimera-linux.org) bare-metal on Android devices with [Halium](https://halium.org)
and [libhybris](https://github.com/libhybris/libhybris).

This doc assumes you already have a general knowledge in how porting a Linux distro with downstream
kernel works (and ideally have an Ubuntu Touch port for example ready to use kernel artifacts from)

## Porting
Since I don't yet have proper kernel/base package cports integration done for anything there's some
*very rough* notes in [`PORTING.md`](PORTING.md) which boil down to having a bootloader unlocked
treble Android 9â€“13 device and existing Halium adapted kernel artifacts (`*boot.img` and modules as
needed) ready to deploy.


## Building some extra packages
Before generating a rootfs image we need to build some required packages. Assuming you're
cross-building on a foreign (non-Chimera Linux) x86_64 host:
```sh
# NOTE: adjust target Halium version as needed
halium_version=12

git clone clone https://github.com/JamiKettunen/cports -b hybris ~/cports
pushd ~/cports
wget https://repo.chimera-linux.org/apk/apk-x86_64-3.0.0_pre6-r0.static -O apk
chmod +x apk
PATH=$PWD:$PATH
./cbuild keygen
./cbuild binary-bootstrap
pkgs="
main/dinit
user/libgbinder
user/wayfire-droidian
user/halium-gsi-$halium_version.0
"
for p in $pkgs; do ./cbuild pkg -a aarch64 ${p}; done
popd

mkdir -p overlays/{base,halium-$halium_version}/pkgs
mv ~/cports/packages/user/aarch64/halium-gsi-$halium_version*.apk overlays/halium-$halium_version/pkgs/
cp ~/cports/packages/main/aarch64/dinit-*.apk overlays/base/pkgs/
cp ~/cports/packages/user/aarch64/*.apk overlays/base/pkgs/
rm overlays/base/pkgs/*-{headers,devel,doc}-*.apk
```


## Generating /tmp/chimera-rootfs.img
Using [`config.vidofnir.sh`](config.vidofnir.sh) as an example:
```sh
./mkrootfs.sh config.vidofnir.sh
```
NOTE: By default assumes:
1. `chimera-chroot` from https://github.com/chimera-linux/chimera-install-scripts to be available via e.g.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chimera-linux/chimera-install-scripts
PATH=$PWD/chimera-install-scripts:$PATH
```
2. e.g. `qemu-aarch64-static` is installed and its binfmt setup already done
3. `sudo` is used, otherwise e.g. `echo 'SUDO=doas' > config.local.sh`


## Deploying and booting
NOTE: We call the `rootfs.img` instead as `ubuntu.img` when using Halium initrd to make the cleanest
possible mount hierarchy configuration on final rootfs without polluting it with double-mounts under
`/android` etc.
- place generated rootfs image as `ubuntu.img` on `userdata` root (unencrypted, ext4!)
  - with device in e.g. UBports recovery (TWRP should work too minus `simg` steps), run on host:
```sh
# NOTE: simg song and dance can require up to 2x $SIZE set in mkrootfs.sh/config.*.sh of free space
# on both the host /tmp and target userdata!
adb shell 'mount /data'
img2simg /tmp/chimera-rootfs.img /tmp/chimera-rootfs.simg && rm /tmp/chimera-rootfs.img
adb push /tmp/chimera-rootfs.simg /data/rootfs.simg
adb shell 'simg2img /data/rootfs.simg /data/ubuntu.img && rm /data/rootfs.simg && chmod 644 /data/ubuntu.img'
adb shell 'sync && reboot'
```


### Logging in (via USB)
As your SSH public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) is copied onto the rootfs by default you should be able to log in as both `hybris` (default password: `1234`) and `root`.
```sh
ssh hybris@10.15.19.82
# or
ssh root@10.15.19.82
```


### Wayfire (Wayland compositor)
This is currently the only known working GPU rendering test you can do. Auto-login via `greetd` is
enabled by default which should bring it up on the display but you may also launch it via `conspy`
(tty1) as described below after `dinitctl stop greetd` for further debugging as needed:
```sh
doas dinitctl stop greetd
doas conspy 1
# login: hybris
wayfire &> /tmp/wayfire.log
```
Then you're free to run graphical clients via e.g. `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 kgx` as `hybris` user.
To stop Wayfire you have to `pkill wayfire` as `^C` in the tty1 doesn't work
